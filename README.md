This is the replication of original work created using TorchMoji model [here](https://github.com/huggingface/torchMoji)

Here in this research, we will replicate a work that used millions of emoji occurrences to study any domain illustrations in order to detect sentiment, emotion and sarcasm underlying. TorchMoji is a [pyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of the [DeepMoji](https://github.com/bfelbo/DeepMoji) model developped by Bjarke Felbo, Alan Mislove, Anders SÃ¸gaard, Iyad Rahwan and Sune Lehmann. 

This model trained on 1.2 billion tweets with emojis to understand how language is used to express emotions. Through transfer learning the model can obtain state-of-the-art performance on many emotion-related text modeling tasks.
